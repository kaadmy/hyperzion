Things to do, in no particular order:

## Test to ensure VBO rendering works

## Implement MRenderer::Model

- Model loader
  - Binary storage
- Blender exporter
- Static model with no animations

## Implement MRenderer::Camera3D and MRenderer::Camera2D

- Dynamic switching between cameras
- Only one active camera instance at a time

## Implement MRenderer::Material

- Texture loading
- Material definition loading
  - Material definition format

## Sound playback

- OpenAL (should look into loaders, libogg/libvorbis are possibilities)
- Music playback
