This version of PhysFS has been modified by KaadmY to accommodate for Hyperzion.

Based off the official source tarball of PhysFS 3.0.1.

Notable changes:

- Disabled shared library build.
- Disabled test binary build.
- Disabled most archive types (except ZIP)
- Cut out parts of CMakeLists.txt that seem unneeded, this may cause issues later so I'm leaving a note here. Huge success.
