# [Hyperzion](https://github.com/kaadmy/hyperzion) v0.1.0

A tunnel racing game.

## How to play

You don't, haha.

## Building

### *nix

1. Create build directory: `mkdir build; cd build`
2. Run CMake: `cmake ..`
3. Run Make: `make`

The resulting binary is placed in the project's root directory, not the build directory.
You can run it with `../hyperzion`, or `./hyperzion` if you're already in the root directory.

### MacOS
